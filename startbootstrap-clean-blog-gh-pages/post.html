                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was a warm, September 2019, summer evening. The mosquitos were in full swing, blood-sucking the life out of me and my boyfriend, while we lounged in his parent&rsquo;s backyard. We were listening to Burna Boy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twice as Tall&rdquo; album on repeat. I was sipping on Kirkland Sangria, feeling good - in my feelings, as Burna Boy was singing about overcoming his struggles (or something like that) when bae interrupted the song we were listening by saying: &ldquo;Uh, soooo&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll be going to Tulum next week with my friends on vacation.&rdquo; I paused the music and said: &ldquo;oh, really?&rdquo; Bae: &ldquo;yeah, it was a last-minute plan, it&rsquo;s going to be a guy&rsquo;s only trip&rdquo;. Me: &ldquo;oooooooooh, ok&hellip;. You <strong>do know</strong> we are in the <strong>middle of a COVID-19 pandemic</strong> right?&rdquo; Bae: &ldquo;yes, but Mexico is open, and I&rsquo;m turning 30.so the boys and I are going to Tulum&rdquo;. Me: &ldquo;ok, have fun.&rdquo; Silence. Conversation over. Period. Now as much as the heavens had been working on my petty tendencies, I was still a work in progress. I spent the next couple of days walking around with a salty look on my face, thinking to myself:</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">HOW COULD HE be going to Mexico right now.</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Did he forget that we are going through a GLOBAL PANDEMIC (or whatever the news says)?</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">How long did he know about this vacation, and why did he conveniently only tell me about this ONE WEEK BEFORE?</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hold up, why wasn&rsquo;t I invited?</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">THE AUDACITY.</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For the most part, I was jealous that I was not invited for his birthday turn up. But at the end of the day I had no complaints due to the way my bank account was looking. There was NO WAY I could afford to go on a trip to Tulum at the time. I eventually checked my attitude and forgot about bae&rsquo;s birthday plans.</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Fast forward a couple of days later, bae came back to me with a new plan. Bae: &ldquo;Soooooo... the boys and I decided to take our girls on this trip&rdquo;. Me: &ldquo;Ohhhhhhh reaaaaally?&rdquo; Bae: &ldquo;yes&hellip; so do you want to come?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;I wish I could, but the way my bank account is looking, I cannot afford this expense&rdquo;. Bae: &ldquo;What if I told you that I will pay for your accommodations?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. Ok, I&rsquo;m down&rdquo;. And just like that, my COVID worries, financial troubles, and FBI investigations were gone. CHA-CHING, I was GOING ON VACATION.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br>The next few days were a blur of hair, nail, and eyelash extension appointments, shopping trips, google searches of &ldquo;things to do in Tulum&rdquo;, and vlog reviews of Tulum on YouTube. I had no idea what to expect.</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">All I knew was that Mexico had beaches and margaritas&hellip; and I was ready to sip, dip, and enjoy my trip. On September 21 2019 bae and I hopped on our 4-hour, non-stop plane ride from JFK airport with three other couples, and arrived at the Cancun airport ready to relax and enjoy ourselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Once we hit the Cancun runway, it finally hit me. I was in Mexico baby! We gathered our luggage and went to Hertz car rental to pick up the two rental cars we booked in advance. <strong>Tip: there are plenty of car rental sites right outside the airport which offer competitive pricing and discounted rates. Be sure to do your research beforehand, so you know the market price of rentals before you arrive.&nbsp;</strong>Once we finalized the paperwork at Hertz Car Rental company, we hopped in our rental car and drove approximately hour away to our Airbnb in La Valetta, Tulum.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When we arrived at our Airbnb, I was beyond impressed with our luxurious villa, which was equipped with a huge private plunge pool <strong><em>and</em></strong> jacuzzi, with four master bedrooms, a large kitchen, dining room and daily cleaning service. To this day, I still don&rsquo;t know how much that villa cost, but I definitely know some coins were spent. The good news for us was, due to COVID-19, our group managed to get a generous discount on the overall price of the place, since not many tourists were travelling to Mexico at the time. Our villa was centrally located 10 minutes away from the beach on one side, and 10 minutes away from Tulum&rsquo;s town center on another side, which ended up being super convenient for our daily adventures.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Tulum is a relatively small beach town that has a main town center, numerous cenotes, wildlife experiences, the infamous Mayan Ruins and white sand turquoise beaches, which all make for a very eventful week of sight-seeing. While Tulum is lively and vibrant, it still had a very casual, relaxed vibe. The main town center is lined up with many unique restaurants, gift shops, boutiques, bars, tattoo parlors, pharmacies: you name it &ndash; all in walking distance. There are food options for even the pickiest of eaters. Meat-lovers, vegetarians, pescatarians, gluten-free, lactose-free, and dairy-free enthusiasts will all easily be fed with the numerous food joints in Tulum<u>.</u> If you are a fan of nature &ndash; Tulum is the perfect place for you, as it is home to some of the most <strong><u>beautiful cenotes</u></strong> in Quintana Roo. A cenote i</span><span style="font-size:14px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;color: rgb(32, 33, 34);background-color: white;">s a natural&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;'>pit or sinkhole</span><span style="font-size:14px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;color: rgb(32, 33, 34);background-color: white;">&nbsp;that forms when limestone rock collapses inward to the point where groundwater is exposed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Our group was able to visit Grand Cenote during our stay. The cool crystal-clear water at Grand Cenote were breathe-taking. <strong>Tip: when visiting any Cenote, please be considerate of the surrounding wild life, as it is common to see harmless fish and turtles swimming alongside you. Before we were allowed to enter each Cenote, we had to shower to remove any harmful products that could hurt the wildlife, so be sure to keep that in mind before spraying excess amounts of mosquito repellant, sunscreen, fragrances etc. on yourself.</strong> While we were not able to see the Mayan Ruins on our trip, we definitely made time to spend a whole day soaking in the sun at the beach. Note: the road to the beach is split into two sections centered at a roundabout. If you turn left at the roundabout, you will drive into the public beach entrance where you can enjoy free access to the beach, inexpensive lounging accommodations, and experience a serene vibe at one of my favorite food joints called &ldquo;Poncho Villa&rdquo;. If you turn right at the roundabout, you will enter the &ldquo;hotel zone&rdquo; portion of the beach, where you will find an unlimited selection of luxury beach clubs which usually charge a &ldquo;minimum consumption fee&rdquo; to access their lounging amenities. Our group decided to visit Mia Beach club in the hotel zone, where we spent the day lounging on beach beds, relaxing, and eating amazing food. &nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Tulum is also known for its popular nightlife scene. Whether you want to dance the night away at the beach, or people-watch and enjoy a nice drink in town &ndash; there is a party vibe for everyone. Due to COVID, our group chose to avoid large crowds and focus more on sight-seeing activities. But hopefully someday soon, we will all be able to enjoy communal gatherings again!</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Sadly, Mexico has been highlighted in a negative light when it comes to discussions on crime and overall safety. My response to these negative stories is this: anything can happen to you in ANY country. I encourage anyone who is unsure to dust off your fears and experience Tulum for yourself. The greatest advice I can give to any traveler is: <strong>be aware of your surroundings at all times.</strong> Keep valuables stored in a safe place, and do not leave any of your personal items unattended. If you are a solo traveler be sure to avoid walking in dimly lit areas by yourself, and try to navigate in areas where many people are stationed. If you are travelling with a group of friends, stick together, and keep fancy jewelry and expensive electronics secured in a safe space. We learned this lesson the hard way when our friends iPhone was snatched out of her hand by a person on a bike, while we mindlessly walked home late at night. Don&rsquo;t be like us. Be alert, and you should be just fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My vacation to Tulum was one of my favorite travel experiences. The atmosphere, the food, the drinks, and the beaches were AMAAAAZING. One week flew by way too fast. When I arrived back in NYC, I could not stop thinking about the dreamy turquoise beaches, and lovely cenotes I once visited&hellip;. which made me rethink my life&hellip;.&nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:13px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br>Stay tuned for <strong><u>HOW MEXICO CHANGED MY LIFE PART TWO &ndash; Moving to Tulum coming soon!</u></strong></span></p>
